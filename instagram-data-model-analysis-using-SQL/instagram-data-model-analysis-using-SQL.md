## Analytics Examples
### WHERE Condition
```
-- Selecting all the posts where user_id is 1
SELECT *
FROM Posts
WHERE user_id = 1;
```
### ORDER BY
```
-- Selecting all the posts and ordering them by created_at in descending order
SELECT *
FROM Posts
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### GROUP BY and HAVING
```
-- Counting the number of likes for each post and showing only the posts with more than 2 likes
SELECT Posts.post_id, COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
FROM Posts
LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
GROUP BY Posts.post_id
HAVING COUNT(Likes.like_id) > 2;
```

### Aggregation Functions
```
-- Finding the total number of likes for all posts
SELECT SUM(num_likes) AS total_likes
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
    FROM Posts
    LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
    GROUP BY Posts.post_id
) AS likes_by_post;
```

### Subquery
```
-- Finding the total number of likes for all posts
SELECT SUM(num_likes) AS total_likes
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
    FROM Posts
    LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
    GROUP BY Posts.post_id
) AS likes_by_post;
```

### Windows function
```
-- Finding the total number of likes for all posts
SELECT SUM(num_likes) AS total_likes
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
    FROM Posts
    LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
    GROUP BY Posts.post_id
) AS likes_by_post;
```

### CTE
```
-- Finding the total number of likes for all posts
SELECT SUM(num_likes) AS total_likes
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
    FROM Posts
    LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
    GROUP BY Posts.post_id
) AS likes_by_post;
```

### CASE Statement
```
-- Categorizing the posts based on the number of likes
SELECT
    post_id,
    CASE
        WHEN num_likes = 0 THEN 'No likes'
        WHEN num_likes < 5 THEN 'Few likes'
        WHEN num_likes < 10 THEN 'Some likes'
        ELSE 'Lots of likes'
    END AS like_category
FROM (
    SELECT Posts.post_id, COUNT(Likes.like_id) AS num_likes
    FROM Posts
    LEFT JOIN Likes ON Posts.post_id = Likes.post_id
    GROUP BY Posts.post_id
) AS likes_by_post;
```

### Date Casting and Working with Dates
```
-- Finding all the posts created in the last month
SELECT *
FROM Posts
WHERE created_at >= CAST(DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '1 month') AS DATE);
```
